- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

I overloaded the constructors in each class. I chose to do this because in this program it does not make sense to overload any of the 'functional' methods. So, when I overloaded the constructors I was making different cases and each had different starting attributes of a House, Cafe, or Library. In some cases there was only a name and not an address, in one of the overloaded Library constructors I made a Library that already came with a pre-set library of books that would be textbooks for the courses. The variations go on and on, however, overloading the constructors was 1. fun and let me be creative (i added an attribute for the Library class) and 2. the most practical because it allows variation and different realistic attributes to a blueprint of one of these buildings.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I definitely did not give myself the most time and I think thats because I saw only 2(3) phases and assumed it would be pretty easy. It was not too bad, but it took a bit of thinking and reveiwing class sides. Additiomally when I would get tripped up it was nice to look at Geeks for Geeks for example to read the difference between Overriding vs Overloading.
